# Getting Started with Chatly
## ONLINE CHAT APPLICATION

Chatly is an online chatting application created using react.js and node.js. The application uses the socket.io module to create the chat functions. Login is the initial step to access the chat window. If new user, they are asked for sign up first which is authenticated by one time password verification sent to the registered mail id by the node-mailer module. This is now a basic version of the chatting interface wherein the attractive features are about to be added on later versions of this application.
